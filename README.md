# ancient_finders


Ancient Finders is a Real Time Strategy game that I developed for my grade 11 computer science course. My goal for this project was to familiarize myself with Java and the Greenfoot JDE. The game features a map that houses two teams, the player, and the AI. The main objective of this game is to destroy the other team's base at the other end of the map. This is achieved through the completion of smaller, sub-goals, one of which is to gain control of the center where gold is contested. The AI is extremely efficient with its troop placement and extremely intelligent in terms of troop positioning. To my surprise, a few of my classmates found different strategies to beat this, so give it a shot and I hope you enjoy the game!
